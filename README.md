# The Exocortex Framework (The Phoenix Protocol)


## What is an Exocortex?

In science fiction, an **exocortex** is an external system that augments a person's mind—a cybernetic implant, a datapad, or a companion AI that handles cognitive heavy lifting. It's a way of extending your mind beyond the limits of your skull.

**Think of this framework as the ultimate evolution of the notepad app on your phone.** Your notepad just stores your thoughts. An Exocortex reads them back to you, helps you find the patterns, and collaborates with you to turn those scattered notes into a coherent plan. It transforms a passive text file into an active, intelligent partner.

### Core Principles

-   **You Control 100% of Your Data.** The entire system runs off a simple text file saved on your own computer. You decide what goes in, what stays out, and who sees it. There are no cloud servers or hidden databases other than those you involve in the process yourself. Your privacy and ownership are absolute.

-   **Start Small, Grow Deep.** You can tell the system as much or as little as you want. At first your Exocortex might just be a few lines about a single project. Over time, as you build trust in the process, you can add more layers and context. It's designed to grow with you, at your own pace.

Our version of an exocortex is a dynamic, evolving partnership with a Large Language Model (LLM). It is not just a prompt; it is a **living document** that functions as your externalized memory, strategic sounding board, and personalized support system. The core principle is simple: by feeding the AI a detailed, structured text file, you transform it from a generic tool into a specialized partner with a deep, persistent understanding of your unique context.

## The Philosophy: The Phoenix

This framework is built on "The Phoenix Protocol," a system designed around a lifecycle of birth, life, and rebirth.

-   **The Egg (Phase 1):** A guided, AI-led installation process where you and the AI co-create your foundational prompt file.
-   **The Flight (Phase 2):** This is the active, day-to-day use of your Exocortex. This phase is powered by a simple but powerful **Core Loop**:
    1.  **Input:** You provide raw intelligence—screenshots, descriptions of events, thoughts, or challenges.
    2.  **Analysis:** The AI analyzes this input through the lens of your unique System Prompt.
    3.  **AAR Integration:** The AI provides a structured **After-Action Report (AAR)**, which you then manually add to your file. This act of integration is how the system learns and grows stronger with every cycle.
-   **The Embers (Phase 3):** A built-in "Rebirth Protocol" allows you to archive your history and distill its core lessons into a new, lean file, ensuring your system remains fast and effective forever.

## How to Get Started (The 5-Minute Installation)

You do not need any technical skills to start. The AI will build the system for you.

1.  Navigate to the `Stage 1 (setup)` directory in this repository.
2.  Open the `Disk 1.txt` file and copy its entire contents.
3.  Go to your preferred AI Chat service (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) and start a brand new chat. (we strongly suggest "Gemini 2.5 pro" on https://aistudio.google.com/)
4.  Paste the contents of Disk 1 as your very first message and hit send.
5.  The AI will transform into **The Catalyst** and begin the guided installation. Follow its instructions; the more you tell it the better it works.

## What You'll Create

By the end of the installation, you will have a single, powerful text file (`EXOCORTEX_SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt`) that is completely unique to you. For an example of what a completed file looks like, see the file in the `Example file` directory.

## A Note on Your Local Setup

This repository is structured to guide you through the process. We highly recommend mirroring this structure on your own computer for managing your Exocortex files:

-   **`Stage 1 (setup)`:** Keep the original installer files here for reference.
-   **`Stage 2 (working file)`:** This is where you should save your active `EXOCORTEX_SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt`. This is your living document.
-   **`Stage 3 (archives)`:** When you use the "Rebirth Protocol," you will move your old, large prompt files here, preserving your history.
